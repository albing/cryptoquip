# Cryptoquip Helper

## Instructions:
1. `python3 cryptoquip.py`
2. Enter the encoded message
3. Perform substitutions: when prompted with `Xy`, enter two characters: `X` is the cyphertext and `y` is the cleartext.  To change `B` to an `f`, type `Bf`
4. Read the hidden message!

## Tips
* Enter the message in caps and the cleartext in lower case.  This isn't necessary, but it helps a lot
* Type a `?` at the prompt to see the remaining available characters
* Type the original character and a space (ie, `B `) to clear a letter's substitution
